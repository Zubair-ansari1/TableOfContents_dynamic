# TableOfContents_dynamic
This a a dynamic table of contents project. It is my third and also a basic type project. it changes its open/close logo when it is invoked. it display's the table's content when you tap the font(icon) and another font(icon) takes its place. when you tap on the points it will take you to the particular heading with smooth scroll behaviour
